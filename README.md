# linear_regression_cars_dataset
I have performed linear regression, using gradient descent on a dataset of cars,obtained from kaggle.
Cars dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/goyalshalini93/car-data
The dataset contains 26 columns of features about the various models of the different brands of cars.
I've used Pandas to manipulate the data.
I've used the concept of one hot encoding to accomodate non numerical nominal features.
I've implemented gradient descent algorithm manually.
As a end result I've obtained a matrix of theta pertraining to all features ,fitting a model to the data.

Cheers!
